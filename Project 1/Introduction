I have developed a comprehensive road accident analysis dashboard in Power BI, utilizing open data sources specific to the United Kingdom.
The dashboard incorporates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Total number of casualties in the current year (CY), accompanied by a year-over-year (YoY) growth comparison.

Number of accidents involving cyclists (CY), also with a YoY growth comparison.

Breakdown of CY casualties into fatal, serious, and slight categories, providing YoY growth comparisons for each.

Analysis of casualties based on different vehicle types.

Comparison of casualties across months for both the current year and the previous year.

Breakdown of casualties by road type, urban/rural areas, light conditions, and location.

By employing Excel as the data source, I have meticulously examined the data and transformed it into a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard, providing valuable insights into road accidents and their associated factors.
